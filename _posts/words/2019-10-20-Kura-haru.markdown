<div align = "center">
  
Of doors I walked through, <br/>
of doors locked <br/>
and of doors opened <br/>
but dared not step into.<br/>
<br/>
Of the pages wrote on <br/>
and of pages left empty.<br/>
<br/>
Of the lines <br/>
scribbled on my palms, <br/>
of serpentine roads <br/>
and of valleys they lead into. <br/>
<br/>
*****
