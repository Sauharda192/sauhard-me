###### I revisited and redesigned an old magazine cover I made back in 2019. I figuerd that the cover page I made had some layout problem. Which is why I came up with an entirely new composition and used a different typefaces.

###### This re-designed cover, I believe, has much better type contrast and a more dynamic composition.
